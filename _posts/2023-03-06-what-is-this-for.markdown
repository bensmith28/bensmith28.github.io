I'm not exactly sure what this website is for. It's got a posting feature, that may as
well be good for something. I'm going to scribble down some ideas here, and see where
I go with it.

* Log of interesting articles and thoughts thereof
  * subject focus?
    * professional, software things?
    * anything that catches my eyes?
    * do I avoid current events?
  * current events? Seek to be current, or avoid being current?
  * How much can I really expect to add, write about?
* Dear diary... yeah probably not
* ... I'm a little stumped.
